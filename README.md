# Temple Flashcards

## External Feedback

* The colorscheme doesn't look very appealing. The background color doesn't match the tab bar color.
* The temple images could be displayed in a more uniform format.
* The animations are slow (I believe this is because of the simulator).
* Temple names in study mode are too small. It would be nice to make them bigger if you clicked them.


## Temple Experience

I served my LDS mission in Nagoya, Japan, so the closest temple is in Tokyo. Because it was outside of our mission boundaries, we did not get permission to attend it. After two years, my parents came to Japan to pick me up, and we traveled through the country. We were in Tokyo and looking for the temple, which is also where we were going to stay. We got off at a train station and started walking in the general direction of the temple, when all of a sudden it was right in front of us. When we got there, it felt like the world around us stopped, and I could focus on the important things. I remember thinking that even in our busy lives, we should always make time to attend the temple, because it will help us align our actions with the things that matter most.  

## Meaningful Temples

* Japan Tokyo - My "mission" Temple.
* Curitiba Brazil - This was the Temple where I was endowed.
